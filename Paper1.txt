Bumps:

CNN:
-nans in image, used nan_to_num
-pad images that were on edge and so are not square
-overfitting, using rotations

SEP:
-galaxies that are half out of the image
-picking bright stars instead because formula (cite) for galaxies. Cross referenced with SDSS catalog.
	-some objects both classified as star and galaxy. use primary object's classification
	-sometimes star is marked right in center of image. listed number(about 10?) out of the 500. Remove sn light? unlist if at location 	of event?
-images are 3/4 years
- adjusted deblending
- background as variance? because worked best
- if too narrow an object, flux calculation fails, skip over object if not in 
- area is number of pixels
- big problem- few slsne, no host visible for them. will have to fake the data.
- if no galaxy found at center, use photoz from sdss of galaxies in image
- sometimes dif. objects selected in different filters. If image found at center in 1, that location used for all. Kronrad, area, etc. kept; magnitude calculated by flux w/i same radius. Esp b/c chance coincidence formula doesn't work in g filter
- flux and mag calculated same as in se, using 2.5? kronrad
- pixel rank 0 if not in
- For some images with a very bright star near host, a higher threshold is necessary to distinguish host from bright object even with deblending. Raise by 0.3 until it works. Despite loss of accuaracy here
- get rid of nans
- get rid of outliers?
-nondetection flag
subtact bkgrnd or not?
-limitations of sep rather than se?
-what thresh and minarea to use?
-avoid cutting because so few
-coords, ircs vs fk5
-don't make an outlier cut on kronrad because lose a slsne 330114 which gets host detected, but large kronrad because very dim?? 
-10% no detection, almost all really nondetections
-too many matching photozs

- high efficiency, low purity in finding sn1bcs by agressively choosing where they cluster (e.g. pixel rank vs. redshift)
- importance of balancing weights or creating synthetic data because so many more slsne
