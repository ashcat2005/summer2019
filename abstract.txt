With the increasing rates of transient detection by survey telescopes such as the upcomming LSST, the development and improvement of quick and inexpensive supernova classification methods is ... important. While ... in photometry, less attention has been giving to the use of host galaxy and other contextual [information] which contain information valuable in determining the type of a supernova. Using PanSTARRS survey data, we have developed/trained machine learning algorithms to classify supernova solely based on contextual data. We discuss a random forrest classifier trained on extracted host galaxy properties and a convolutional neural network traied directly on host galaxy images. We demonstrate their [usefulness] for [improving] supernova classification and discuss their limitations.
