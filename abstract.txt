With the increasing rates of transient detection by survey telescopes such as the upcomming LSST, the development and improvement of efficient supernova classification methods is increasingly important. While much work has been done in photometry based classification, less attention has been given to the use of event context and host galaxy, which also contain valuable information for determining the type of a supernova. Using PanSTARRS survey data, we trained machine learning algorithms for classifying supernova solely based on contextual information. We discuss a random forest classifier trained on extracted host galaxy properties and a convolutional neural network trained directly on host galaxy images. We demonstrate their value for supernova classification and discuss their limitations.
